## Translating a New Novel

A new novel pick-up has to: 

- not be licensed (I'm actually not 100% sure on how to check this properly so I'll have to figure that out... don't go for novels with 20mil+ views?)
- not already be picked up by another translator (there are exceptions to this, please read the novelupdates guide [here](https://www.novelupdatesforum.com/threads/how-does-novel-updates-work.21477/) and the novelupdates policy [here](https://www.novelupdates.com/nu-policy/), of course, we don't want to make enemies unless we have to.
- not be 18+, if your novel isn't 18+ but has 18+ chaps, you'll have to host them outside of the site like a google drive folder and link to that instead.

80% of our views come from novel updates so make sure your chaps are ones they'll accept.
