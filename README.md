# Translator How To

> A comprehensive and **_incomplete_** guide on how to do translation things at Raei Translations!

## Picking up a New Novel

A new novel pick-up has to: 

- not be licensed (I'm actually not 100% sure on how to check this properly so I'll have to figure that out... don't go for novels with 20mil+ views?)
- not already be picked up by another translator (there are exceptions to this, please read the novelupdates guide [here](https://www.novelupdatesforum.com/threads/how-does-novel-updates-work.21477/) and the novelupdates policy [here](https://www.novelupdates.com/nu-policy/), of course, we don't want to make enemies unless we have to.
- not be 18+, if your novel isn't 18+ but has 18+ chaps, you'll have to host them outside of the site like a google drive folder and link to that instead.

80% of our views come from novel updates so make sure your chaps are ones they'll accept. Also novelpia novels have the lowest chance of dmca and I also have an account that I pay for every 3 months or so + a bot extracter for chaps so novelpia novels are recommended.

## Novel Information

I need your new novel's
- Title
- korean title
- novel updates link
- link to the raws (if you're extracting from a third-party, I need a link to the third-party and the actual, official source)
- novel summary
- title id (just the novel title but lower case, separated by hyphens and no symbols, ex: I Became a 6★ Gacha Character -> i-became-a-6-gacha-character)
- abr (abbrieviation, I like to sort the novels into 3 letter abbrieviations. Make up one from your novel's title, ex: I Became a 6★ Gacha Character -> IBG)

In the future you'll insert this into the website yourself, but for now, give them to me.

## Novel Updates

You need to add your novel to novel updates if one does not already exist for the novel.

### Novel Updates Add Series

You need to post the first chapter first. Since there isn't a translator app yet, I'll do that for you, just tell me when you are ready. 

After that, add a new novel series [here](https://www.novelupdates.com/add-series/)

You're going to need:
- novel image
- series name
- description
- associated names (the korean title of the novel)
- type (go web novel if you don't know)
- genre (this is editable, so pick at least one and come back)
- tags (this is also editable, pick one, come back. The list is long, you can see them all [here](https://www.novelupdates.com/list-tags/?limit=all&st=1&sort=abc&order=asc))
> also, tags are very important, but hard to fill in when you're just starting the novel, come back at some point and go through the list and fill them out for the novel
- author
- artist (not neccessary, but if you know, go ahead)
- year (just put the year the first chap was posted)
- original publisher (like novelpia)

We then need to post the first chapter if we haven't already and link it to novel updates [here](https://www.novelupdates.com/add-release/). Then we wait! A full day is usually enough to have everything set up.

## Discord

Next up, Discord!

### Novel Roles

I'm not yet sure if I should give translators the perm to make roles so I'll do it for you for now. Make sure to give me the novel's abr since we use the abr for as the role name. Also, you can tell me the emoji you want associated with the novel role if you care. System emojis only unfortunately.

### Novel Channel and Illustrations Channel


### Novel Announcement

Next you need to make a novel announcement. You have perms to tag people who have opted for the @Novel Announcements tag so go right ahead and do it for your post. Make sure to include in your post:
- a link to the discord novel channel
- a link to the novel updates novel page
- a link to the discord illustrations channel
- a link to novel roles as well as tagging the novel role itself
- a link to the first chapter of the novel
- anything else you'd like to add. Maybe a little introduction if you're new?

## Raei Translations Site
Unfortunately, no app for you guys to post just yet, but I'll make one soon. We'll set up a google drive folder instead with two sub folders: ready and posted. Place your chapters inside ready and I'll post them when it is time. Please include the chapter number in the title of the chapter file. Bonus points if it is a .txt file.

## Posting and Scheduling

I recommend posting multiple chapters a day for the first week of your novel pickup. It gives it a huge boost in viewership and if you end the mass release at a good chap(like a cliff), you might see a few advance chapter subscriptions which is where most of your revenue will come from. 

5 chapters/week is a good number, 4 minimum. Of course, life happens and sometimes you have to step away from that baseline but, to grow viewership, consistent daily posting > haphazard/random/all at once posting

## Advance Chapters and Ad Revenue

- to be continued.
