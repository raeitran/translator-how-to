## Translating a New Novel

A new novel pick-up has to: 

- not be licensed (I'm actually not 100% sure on how to check this properly so I'll have to figure that out... don't go for novels with 20mil+ views?)
- not already be picked up by another translator (there are exceptions to this, please read the novelupdates guide [here](https://www.novelupdatesforum.com/threads/how-does-novel-updates-work.21477/) and the novelupdates policy [here](https://www.novelupdates.com/nu-policy/)
